# Multi-Agent Product Discussion Simulator

## Project Description

**Multi-Agent Product Discussion Simulator** is a locally hosted AI-based system that simulates structured conversations between a **Product Manager (PM)**, **Engineer**, and **Designer**, all coordinated by a **Moderator agent**. 

Each agent operates independently based on role-specific prompts, while the Moderator ensures productive dialogue by detecting conflicts, identifying gaps in discussion, and enforcing role adherence.

Built using **LangChain**, **Mistral** (via **Ollama**), and **Python**, this project is ideal for:
- Simulating product development discussions  
- Practicing role-based decision-making  
- Exploring collaborative behavior of autonomous agents
